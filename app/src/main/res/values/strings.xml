    <string name="app_name">Sunrise Cafe</string>
    <string name="about_text">We are a little charming Cafe located near the Mission Bay - one of Auckland’s favourite beachside destinations. The golden beach is safe for swimming year-round, and is nestled right next to The Promendade – Auckland’s only strip of beachside dining, drinking, and shopping outlets. With stunning views, fresh sea-salt air, and a friendly beach-side culture; it’s a real slice of paradise.

\n\nMany people comment on what great staff we have - we all know how important it is to have people who are enthusiastic and passionate about their work - we love to meet new customers and enjoy a strong base or regulars who return daily for great coffee or catching up with friends while enjoying a meal or snack from our extensive menus.

\n\nSunrise Cafe is the perfect destination to head to with friends and family to enjoy homemade cakes or just a simple cup of tea or coffee! We love watching the sunrise and we invite you to come along and join our community! </string>
